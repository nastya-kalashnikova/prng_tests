Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow 

Oh, in the meadow a red kalyna has bent down low,
For some reason, our glorious Ukraine is in sorrow.
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we'll take that red kalyna and we will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!

Do not bend low, oh red kalyna, you have a white flower,
Do not worry, glorious Ukraine, you have a free people.
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we'll take that red kalyna and will raise it up,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!

Marching forward, our fellow volunteers, into a bloody fray,
For to free our brother Ukrainians from the Moscovite shackles.
And we, our brother Ukrainians, we will then liberate,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we, our brothers Ukrainians, will then liberate,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!

Oh in the field of early spring wheat, there's a golden furrow,
Then began the Ukrainian riflemen to engage the enemy.
And we'll take that precious, early wheat and will gather it,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And we'll take that precious, early wheat and will gather it,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!

When the stormy winds blow forth from the wide steppes,
They will glorify, throughout Ukraine, the Sich Riflemen.
And so we will preserve the glories of these riflemen,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
And so we will preserve the glories of these riflemen,
And, hey-hey, we shall cheer up our glorious Ukraine!
